## Call for papers

This year’s theme, “Information in Repair,” centers the maintenance and reparative work that is always required, but rarely lauded, across information systems. Scholarly attention and resources are often directed towards the new and novel, the conceptualization and design of innovative systems and interventions. This tendency risks ignoring opportunities to learn from the vast amount of knowledge, practice and technical expertise that goes into monitoring, adjusting, and navigating changes within critical, long-term components of longer-term/ongoing/continuing information systems. We are particularly interested in information science perspectives on practices of disposability or reuse, of reparative work, and theories of repair. We invite creative and expansive views of what is being repaired and maintained, as well as exploration of repair itself as information work. As CAIS seeks to be a home for information science across Canada, our yearly conference routinely develops and supports scholarship in:
- Information seeking and behaviour
- Information literacy and education
- Knowledge management and organization
- Information technologies and systems
- Social media
- Bibliometrics and scholarly communication
- Information policy and ethics
- Cultural heritage and preservation
- Health information management
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion in information science
Diverse and innovative perspectives (theoretical and applied) and methodologies are welcome.


## Types of proposals

CAIS/ACSI welcomes proposals for papers, lightning talks, or panels focused on empirical, theoretical, and practice-based research. Proposals may be submitted in English or French. All proposals will undergo peer review. Paper and lightning talks should be anonymized for submission; panel submissions will include identifying information.

- <strong>Full paper</strong>: 2000-3000 words excluding references. 
- <strong>Work in progress</strong>: 1000-2000 words excluding references.
- <strong>Poster</strong>: 500-1000 words excluding references.
- <strong>Panel</strong>: 500-1000 words excluding references.

## Presenter Information
<strong>Papers:</strong> 20-minute oral presentations of completed or well-developed projects on topics suitable for publication in scholarly journals. Proposals reporting on completed or ongoing research will be given preference. Diverse and innovative perspectives (theoretical and applied) and methodologies are welcome. Proposals should be in the form of an extended abstract (approximately 1000-1500 words excluding references). 

<strong>Lightning Talks:</strong> 5-minute oral presentations covering a single element of a work in progress, or a new idea. Lightning talk proposals aiming to cover an entire research project will not be accepted. The purpose of a lightning talk is to start a discussion, receive input on an idea, or find collaborators. Proposals should be in the form of a 250-word abstract (excluding references). 

<strong>Panels:</strong> 90-minute oral presentations from three or more authors on emerging domains, trends, or contrasting viewpoints, including time for questions or discussion. Panels are an opportunity to engage in discussion of shared concerns, including those not available in completed research or yet adequately recognized. Proposals should not be simply a set of related paper presentations; we encourage proposals that offer creative and unique opportunities for engagement and discussion with the audience as part of the panel session. We recommend three to five panelists plus a moderator; there will be an opportunity to modify the list of panelists after acceptance. Proposals should be in the form of an extended abstract (approximately 1000-1500 words excluding references), that identifies the topic to be discussed, provides an overview of the structure of the panel, and includes relevant qualifications and contributions of each participating panelist.

<strong> Virtual poster presenters</strong>: Presenters at the virtual poster session will each have 5 minutes to present, and approximately 5 minutes for questions. Please share your poster via screenshare when presenting over Zoom. Links will be made available on the conference website. This session will be moderated.

<strong>Poster sizing </strong>: 36" x 48" (91.4 x 122cm) portrait orientation. 

<strong>Virtual poster session information </strong>: Virtual poster presenters will be allocated a timeslot in the final program. While we do not provide specific requirements around dimensions and orientation, posters should resemble traditional print versions. See the 2021 CAIS program for examples [here](https://www.cais2021.ca/).

Posters presenters who originally submitted a paper to the conference are welcome to shorten their submission to a 500-1,000 abstract for the conference proceedings.

## Submissions

<strong>Submissions to CAIS 2025 are now closed.</strong>

## Student research forum

We are pleased to invite master’s and doctoral students at any stage of their program to CAIS’s Student Research Forum. The Forum aims to allow graduate students to discuss their research projects, get feedback, and connect with other students. Please be prepared to present informally on an aspect of your research for 5-10 minutes. More information about participating in the Forum will be provided when Registration opens in March.

<strong>Submissions to the Student Research Forum are now closed.</strong>
