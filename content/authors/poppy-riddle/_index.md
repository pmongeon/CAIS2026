# About me

I am a PhD candidate at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/school-of-information-management.html) where I am researching the intersection of scholarly communication, bibliometric metadata, and generative AI. My dissertation is about how bibliometric metadata's characteristics and errors affect the retrieval and response generation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. 

Interests:

- Scholarly Communications infrastructure
- Biblliometrics and bibliometric-enhanced information retrieval (BIR)
- Bibliometric Metadata
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
